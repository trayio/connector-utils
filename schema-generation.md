# Schema Generation

## Overview

A standardised way of generating operation input schemas in manual connectors.

## Advantages

### Clean code

The `schema.js` files only require one function for schema generation. The way that the parameters are passed looks very clean, minimal and easy to read.

### Immutable schema

The operation input schema returned from the generator function is a deep copy of the original schema definition. Therefore, you cannot mutate or alter the original schema in any way.

### Easy override of properties

The original schema definition defines the standard properties to be used by the connector operations but it is easy to override any schema property in any operation by providing a new value.

### DRY schema elements

Since each schema element is only defined once and reused across operations there is no need to repeat yourself and duplicate code.

## Concepts

### One schema object

The entire schema definition for the whole connector is combined into one object.

You can split this up into separate helper files to make it more manageable and then require and combine those definitions in another helper file.

### One generator function

There is one generator function that can generate the schema definition for any operation.

Simply, call the function and pass in an object with the schema keys that you require.

Override any schema parameter by providing a new value.

## Example operation schema

### Show me the code ðŸ‘€

```javascript
const { generateInputSchema } = require('@trayio/connector-utils');
const { fullSchema } = require('../../../helpers/schema');

module.exports = {
	description: 'Create a new line item.',
	input: generateInputSchema({
		operation: 'createLineItem',
		schema: fullSchema,
		keys: {
			order: { required: true },
			quantity: {
				required: true,
				description: 'Number of units ordered.',
			},
			notes: { description: 'Notes for this specific ordered product.' },
			is_packed: {},
			packed_at: {},
			packed_by: {},
		},
	}),
};
```

### Explanation

1. Require the schema generation function from `@trayio/connector-utils`

2. Require the full connector schema definition from a helper file. The full schema can be made up of many schema fragments that are required from other helper files and assembled into one full schema definition for the whole connector.

3. Export the schema definition, as usual.

4. Include any schema parameters and functions, as normal

5. To generate the input schema, call the `generateInputSchema` function and pass in an object containing the `operation` name, the full connector `schema` and any schema `keys` and values that you require for the operation

    1. In this case, we are asking for the the schema definitions corresponding to the following named keys: `order`, `quantity`, `notes`, `is_packed`, `packed_at` and `packed_by`

    2. The first two keys (`order` and `quantity`) are required, so we assign an object to those keys that overrides the `required` key with a value of `true`, i.e.

        ```javascript
        {
        	required: true;
        }
        ```

    3. The second and third keys (`quantity` and `notes`) need different descriptions than those provided by the standard schema definition so we override them as follows:

        ```javascript
            quantity: { required: true, description: 'Number of units ordered.' },
            notes: { description: 'Notes for this specific ordered product.' },
        ```

    4. The rest of the keys will take values that have been defined in the standard schema definition. This is done by assigning an empty object `{}` to the keys. Since the object contains no keys or values, there is nothing to override.

## Sample Connector

The `connector-utils` package contains a sample connector wit unit tests. You can view the code here and see how it all fits together. It includes:

-   Helper files to define and assemble the connector's full input schema
-   Operations that use the generator function
-   Unit tests that verify that the schema was generated correctly and that problems were logged correctly.

## Logging Schema Issues

The schema generator automatically checks the generated schema for issues. It will detect when `type` keys and `description` keys are missing.

Issues are logged to the console whenever the schema is generated. In practice, this means that whenever you invoke the `test-runner` or `node-dev main.js` you will be able to see and fix schema issues.

The whole of the operation input schema is checked using a recursive algorithm.

Here's some sample output when using the `test-runner` (warning):

![Test runner log warning](./img/test-runner-log-warning.png)

When using the `test-runner` (error):

![Test runner log error](./img/test-runner-log-error.png)

When using `node-dev main.js`:

![Node-dev log](./img/node-dev-log.png)

Missing `description`s are logged as warnings.

This is really useful for catching and fixing QA issues (before they happen) where input tooltips are missing.

Missing `type`s are logged as errors.

If you see missing types it usually means that the schema key that you requested doesn't exist in the full connector schema object.
